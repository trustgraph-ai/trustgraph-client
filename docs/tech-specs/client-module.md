# TrustGraph Client Module - Technical Specification

## Overview

This module extracts reusable code from the existing TrustGraph Workbench
application and packages it as a standalone client library. The goal is to
enable developers to build TrustGraph user experiences without having to
reimplement API communication and state management from scratch.

## Goals

- Extract and package reusable WebSocket API code from TrustGraph Workbench
- Provide a clean, well-documented interface for TrustGraph WebSocket
  communication
- Enable developers to quickly build TrustGraph UX applications
- Eliminate code duplication across TrustGraph UI projects
- Maintain compatibility with existing TrustGraph backend services

## Non-Goals

- REST API implementations (WebSocket only)
- UI components or presentation layer code
- Backend service implementations
- Authentication/authorization logic beyond what's needed for WebSocket
  connections
- Application-specific business logic
